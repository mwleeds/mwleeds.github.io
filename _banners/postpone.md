Dear friends and family,
<br>
Kyle here. We must share some unfortunate news.
<br>
Calm down, we're still getting married. However, I've just been diagnosed with lymphoma. Yeah, that's cancer. I expect to be in treatment through the spring.
<br>
We've made the difficult decision of postponing our wedding. Please mark your calendars for Memorial Day Weekend 2026.
<br>
We love you and look forward to celebrating with you.
<br>
