    It will be chilly at night so pack extra layers for that!

    On Saturday, the dress code is casual or festival attire, so find something that makes you feel awesome.

    On Sunday, the dress code is resort casual to dressy. We had to look that up too.

    We are planning to have a non-traditional vibe so feel free to wear colorful clothing and practice self-expression.

    Absolutely! Our vision for Saturday is an art-filled gathering full of interactivity and surprises. We would love to include your art project, live music, skill sharing, or group activity you think people will enjoy. Let us know if you'd like to contribute. If you can't think of anything, just bring your adventurous spirit.

- question: Will there be WiFi or cell service available?
  answer: |
    There is no cell service but there is fast WiFi available in most parts of the venue. There are different networks in different parts so you'll have to connect to each separately but they all have the same password.

- question: Can I take photos?
  answer: |
    Please refrain from taking photos during the ceremony unless you're a designated photographer. We would prefer you be fully present for the special moments. However, feel free to take photos during the rest of the weekend, and share them afterwards. We'll have a link on this website where you can upload them.

  answer: |
    Please contact either groom and we can likely find something you can help with. We appreciate it!

- question: Is there any good hiking at the venue?
  answer: |
    Yes, there are some beautiful hiking trails, but please watch out for <a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/health-tip/recognizing-poison-ivy-oak-and-sumac">poison oak</a>! If you're bringing a dog, be aware it can get on their fur as well, and try to avoid walking near the neighbor's pasture which is past the lower camping/parking meadow since they have a guard dog for animals who live there. Walking up the hill behind the cabins is BLM land so you should be fine there.

- question: Can I bring my dog?
  answer: |
    Please bring as many dogs as you possibly can.

- question: What restrooms are available for people who are camping or in the cabins?
  answer: |
    There are two well maintained composting toilet near the cabins. We will also have a portable restroom available there. There are also two showers with hot water and sinks available near the cabins.
