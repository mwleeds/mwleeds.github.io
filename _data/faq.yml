- question: What should I wear?
  answer: |
    At this time of year, weather is usually mild but layers are a good idea. It could be chilly at night!

    On Saturday, the dress code is casual or festival attire, so find something that makes you feel awesome.

    On Sunday, the dress code is resort casual to dressy. We had to look that up too.

    We are planning to have a non-traditional vibe so feel free to wear colorful clothing and practice self-expression.

- question: What kind of shoes should I wear?
  answer: |
    This is an outdoor wedding with uneven ground so please plan accordingly.

- question: When is the RSVP deadline?
  answer: |
    We would appreciate an RSVP by Feb 1st which you can do <a href="/rsvp.html">here</a>! If plans change after that, let us know.

- question: When should I plan to arrive in the area, and when should I plan to leave?
  answer: |
    The main events will be Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon. We expect some people will arrive in the area Saturday, but most guests we've talked to about this are traveling to the Jacksonville area Friday. Whatever gets you there! We have the venue until Monday at noon and you are welcome to stay for an informal gathering Sunday night.

    If you are staying in a room we reserved at the Wine Country Inn, the reservation is for Saturday and Sunday nights. Please let us know if we should add Friday for you.

    This part of Oregon has countless things to see and do. Certainly enough to make a longer trip out of! We'll add suggestions soon - they'll include wineries, lakes, hikes, and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (not just Shakespeare).

- question: Can I bring some art, performance, or activity?
  answer: |
    Absolutely! Our vision for Saturday is an art-filled gathering full of interactivity and surprises. We would love to include your art project, live music, skill sharing, or group activity you think people will enjoy. Let us know if you'd like to contribute. If you can't think of anything, just bring your adventurous spirit.

- question: Will there be WiFi or cell service available?
  answer: |
    There is no cell service but there is fast WiFi available in most parts of the venue. There are different networks in different parts so you'll have to connect to each separately but they all have the same password.

- question: Can I take photos?
  answer: |
    Please refrain from taking photos during the ceremony unless you're a designated photographer. We would prefer you be fully present for the special moments. However, feel free to take photos during the rest of the weekend, and share them afterwards. We'll have a link on this website where you can upload them.

- question: How can I help?
  answer: |
    Please contact either groom and we can likely find something you can help with. We appreciate it!

- question: Is there any good hiking at the venue?
  answer: |
    Yes, there are some beautiful hiking trails, but please watch out for <a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/health-tip/recognizing-poison-ivy-oak-and-sumac">poison oak</a>! If you're bringing a dog, be aware it can get on their fur as well, and try to avoid walking near the neighbor's pasture which is past the lower camping/parking meadow since they have a guard dog for animals who live there. Walking up the hill behind the cabins is BLM land so you should be fine there.

- question: Can I bring my dog?
  answer: |
    Please bring as many dogs as you possibly can.

- question: What restrooms are available for people who are camping or in the cabins?
  answer: |
    There are two clean, well maintained restrooms near the cabins. We will also have a few portable restrooms, including near the camping meadow. There are also two showers with hot water and sinks available near the cabins.
